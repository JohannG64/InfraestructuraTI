            <h1>Why is Informatic security important?</h1></br>

            <div id="Introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2></br>

            <p>In order to answer this question, it is necessary to explain the meaning of informatic security. Informatic security is an area of Informatic that focus on protection of computational structure, and everything related, especially data which is inside a computer or around a network of computers.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Importance">
        </br><h2>Importance</h2></br>
            <p>Taking this into account, the important of informatic security is explained almost by itself; the reason of this argument is that nowadays it is nearly impossible to find a person who does not work with computers, for example: doctors, engineers, psychologists, singers, managers, accountants, lawyers, and many other jobs. It is necessary to say that it has many advantages as making the work easier and faster, saving photos or important data in cloud, allowing people work at the same time in the same place, much information with only one click, etc. The problem with those things is that people have personal data (including money), in their computers, where anyone could steal and take advantage if there would not be some privatization.</p>
            <p>In other words, without informatic security the world would be a complete chaos and the concept of personal data would lose all his meaning. Additionally, this is not the main problem due to the advances of military weapons, because nuclear bombs would not be controlled by the governments anymore, although anyone that have some knowledge about hacking could get the control of launching those bombs and could cause a war.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, it is only a imaginary situation because in real life, there are many ways of security in each part of an app, a mail, a social network, a bank account, in every “macro” software people use like the typical username and password, authentication with face, fingerprints, signatures or in a deep way different protocols of encrypting that are so difficult to decode.</p>
            <p>However, there is a challenge if we are talking about informatic systems, because there is a gap where developers or whoever made the web page, app or system cannot have a lot of control. It is the ignorance of the user because there are users who does not know how to use the system or even make a mistake which ends in a security breach. To solve this, developers have to program their app user interface as intuitive as possible and at the same time deleting the options that allows user to make mistakes, it means taking out buttons which does not have a use in a specific part of a process. </p>
            <p>That is one of the arguments why it is impossible to have a perfect security, because it means there is always a part of the process which cannot be controlled, that without mentioning vulnerabilities with the connection on internet. It means it is not worth to invest in security.</p>
            <p>No, even if we cannot delete the risk, it is possible to reduce it and prevent future attacks which could be mean big amounts of money, years in prison or depending on the system, people’s lives.</p>
            <p>In addition, it is important to mention that the principal enemies of informatic security are crackers not hackers, because there is a huge difference between this people. Crackers find vulnerabilities of apps, web pages, or in general systems in order to get something, or more clearly anything that violates the law (informatic crimes). On the other hand, there are hackers who try to find vulnerabilities of systems too, but with purposes of helping companies or people for improving their security and in some cases get a reward.</p>
            <p>Also, throughout history there have been many cyberattacks to a variety of companies including governments. These attacks have been made by communities of hackers with different purposes, some for impose it ideologist, some for stealing money, some because of revenge and there are some attacks whose impact was serious. This is the case in 2016, which Anonymous and New world hackers worked together as a team causing one of biggest attacks in history due to its impact. The platforms affected were Spotify, Amazon, PlayStation, BBC, CNN, Box, DirecTV, Electronic Arts, Etsy, Roblox, Starbucks, Visa, HBO, Heroku, GitHub, Twitter, in other words, almost every internet public platform. The reason of the attack was that Wikileaks (a hacktivist community) founder Julian Assange was in Ecuador, specifically at their embassy in London, where government granted him asylum, the problem was that they denied his internet access.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, people know the risk of using Internet in general, that is why there are many communities and forums which help to solve this problem. In these forums, people can publish their problem, it does not matter where are people from, they only care about what the problem is, if it is new or it is an old problem (in this case it is faster to get a solution) and then they try to find some way to solve the problem. Such is the importance of security to companies that for example Google continuously publish challenges where people can get prizes in money if they are able to break the security of a specific device or software.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="Conclusion">
        </br><h2>Conclusion</h2></br>
            <p>In conclusion, Informatic security is very important for everybody if we want to have some “control” or organization in the society, because there are possibilities which an attack means people’s lives. So, we need to continue improving the security of our systems in order to reduce those possibilities of an attack and continuing with our normal life.</p>
